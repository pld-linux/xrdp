=== X Session: ===

Sesman uses the /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients script. If you want to change your
desktop environment, you have to edit your ~/.desktop file.

You can also use another script - just modify "UserWindowManager" in the
sesman config file: /etc/xrdp/sesman.ini.

=== Users permitted to log in: ===

By default, members of the "users" group are permitted to log in.  You can
change this by editing "TerminalServerUsers" in the sesman config file.
